Fool-Me
=======
Hello and welcome to my weather app.
This is the my stab at the Techspandex Skills Assessment - Codey Edition.
It is a small application that allows a user to input location data then
displays the current weather information based on that location.
The weather data is provided courtesy of World Weather Online. 
This service is free (with recognition) and returns weather from cities worldwide in XML format.

The files you need for this project are
myWeather.php - the main file containing PHP and HTML markup
javascript.js - just a couple of functions here
style.css - my style sheet link
a directory of images -
 - animation02.gif
 - animation03.gif
 - clear.gif
 - cloudy.gif
 - foggy.gif
 - house3.gif
 - raining.gif
 - sleeting.gif
 - snowing.gif
 - thundering.gif

the input will accept regional cities, international cities, countries, zip codes, IP addresses 

enjoy.
